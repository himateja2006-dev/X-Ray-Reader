# X-Ray-Reader

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that analyses chest X-ray images and predicts the presence of medical conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or normal cases. It is intended to assist healthcare professionals with AI-powered diagnosis.

Features

- Deep learning model trained on chest X-ray datasets
- Input: Chest X-ray image (JPEG/PNG format)
- Output: Predicted disease class (e.g., Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Normal)
- Model evaluation with performance metrics
- Can be extended to a web or mobile interface

Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- PIL
- Flask

## Dataset

The model is trained on a publicly available dataset, such as:
- Chest X-ray Dataset

Model Performance

- Accuracy: 89.98%
